                <div class="coll-text">
                    <p>Reducing energy consumption is one of the biggest goals of green architecture, so it follows that
                        these types of constructions will often include a power source that runs on renewable energy.
                        Not every building is a good choice for solar because it does depend on how much sun exposure and surface area you have.</p>

                <div class="coll-text">
                    <p>Efficient ventilation systems are also key in designing a truly green space. Natural ventilation systems, which rely on the natural forces of wind and buoyancy to bring fresh air into the building, may even be used in areas where climate permits.</p>

                <div class="coll-text">
                    <p>Green design’s focus on the environment starts before the home is even built. Green architects focus on using non-toxic, recycled and sustainable building materials.
                    This means that the carbon emissions during the manufacturing process – as well as the transportation to distribution centers – are factored into the carbon footprint analysis.</p>

                    Is this where we discuss the project goals, the location, the massing, overall floor plans, unit counts, elevations, etc.</p>

                    These are the type of questions we'll discuss in this stage. I can recomend you some types of finatiation
                    or maybe you want to change the build plan a little to fit your budget.</p>

                    <p>Since I was a teenager, adults have taught me the <strong>enviromental problems</strong> 
                        the world has in our time. I decided I wanted to do something to help.</p>
                    <p>Then I learned about <strong>Green Architecture</strong> and I inmediately loved 
                        the concept. I think this type of construction brings lots of personality to a 
                        city while also caring about the enviroment.</p>
                    <p>Renewable energies, sustainable materials, even considering local fauna in the 
                        buildings... All these things amazed me at a deep level. So I have been dedicating 
                        my life to <strong>make the world better one building at a time</strong>.</p>
